Script to build an installer for Windows using Pynsist.


Mu is distributed under the GPL-3.0 license.


We use here the base functions of the script to build a Windows installer for
Spyder, mainly changing the code to generalize its functionality and configuring
the run with more arguments (package name, conda python interpreter, extra
packages, etc.).

As an NSIS installer, the generated Spyder executable has the following command line flags:
https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Docs/Chapter3.html#installerusage

Besides those flags, the installer also has the following command line options
available because it uses the `MultiUser.nsh` header file:

* `/ALLUSERS` to install for all the users
* `/CURRENTUSER` to install only for the current user (default)
